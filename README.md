# New Year Drink Menu
I had the idea to make our New Year party a bit more fun for the guests by making a website where they can order their drinks, me and my friend will be preparing them. 

Ideally I want the guests to walk in, scan a QR code and be sent to the menu website where they can type in their name and select drinks, and after they order a push notification should be sent to our phones to make a certain drink.

### Implemented Features:
1. Navbar
2. Mobile Support (duh)

### Planned Features:
1. Entering the guest's name (Saved in a cookie).
2. Horizontally scrollable drink selection cards.
3. A **pending drinks** page.
4. Push notifications to the waiters (Me and my friend).
