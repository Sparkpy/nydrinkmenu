# New Year Drink Menu

![New Year Menu, Pick your poison.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sparkpy/nydrinkmenu/main/images/logo.png)

I had the idea to make our New Year party a bit more fun for the guests by making a website where they can order their drinks, me and my friend will be preparing them. 

Ideally I want the guests to walk in, scan a QR code and be sent to the menu website where they can type in their name and select drinks, and after they order a push notification should be sent to our phones to make a certain drink.

### Implemented Features:
1. Navbar
2. Login System
3. Vertically scrollable drink selection cards.
4. Brand Select which changes the available coffee options
5. Database where the orders are stored.

### Planned Features:
1. A **pending drinks** page.
2. Push notifications to the waiters (Me and my friend).
